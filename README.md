# template-mastra-base

A production-ready Mastra agent starter. One example agent, full eval pipeline, Docker, CI — everything you need to ship a Mastra agent without building the scaffold yourself.

---

## Quickstart (5 minutes)

**Prerequisites**: Node 22+, Docker Desktop, a Supabase project, an Anthropic API key.

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone <repo> my-agent && cd my-agent
npm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in: APP_SECRET, SUPABASE_*, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# 3. Start local Supabase (first time only)
npx supabase start

# 4. Run
npm run dev
# → Mastra Studio at http://localhost:4111
```

Chat with the `leadIntake` agent in Studio to verify everything works. Send:

> Hi, this is John Smith from Acme Corp (john@acme.io). We need pricing for 50 seats by Friday.

Expected: structured JSON output with all fields populated.

## Reachability

This template's agents are reachable through four standard protocols. Once the dev server is running (`npm run dev`), every registered agent can be called via:

### REST API

Direct HTTP calls. The fastest path for n8n, Make, VAPI, LiveKit, or any HTTP-aware system.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4111/api/agents/leadIntake/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hi, I need a quote"}]}'
```

For streaming responses, use `/stream` instead of `/generate`. Full OpenAPI spec at `/api/openapi.json`. Interactive docs at `/swagger-ui` (dev only).

### A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol)

Google's open standard for agent-to-agent communication. JSON-RPC over HTTP.

```bash
# Get agent card
curl http://localhost:4111/api/.well-known/leadIntake/agent-card.json

# Send a message (JSON-RPC)
curl -X POST http://localhost:4111/api/a2a/leadIntake \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","method":"message/send","params":{"message":{"kind":"message","messageId":"msg-1","role":"user","parts":[{"kind":"text","text":"Hi, I need a quote"}]}}}'
```

Use this when another agent (in CrewAI, LangGraph, ADK, or any A2A-compatible framework) needs to delegate work to this template's agent.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Anthropic's open standard for agent-tool integration. The template's MCPServer exposes every agent as a callable tool at `/api/mcp/base-mcp/mcp`.

To use from Claude Desktop, add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "template-mastra-base": {
      "url": "http://localhost:4111/api/mcp/base-mcp/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Each agent appears as a tool named `ask_<agentId>`. Useful during development (call your own agent from your IDE) and for cross-system integration.

### Studio (visual UI + Editor)

Open `http://localhost:4111` in a browser. Studio provides:

- Interactive chat with each agent
- Trace inspection for every run
- Metrics dashboard (cost, latency, errors)
- **Agent Editor**: Non-developers iterate on agent instructions, prompts, and tools without touching code. Changes are versioned with draft/publish workflow.

The Editor is intended for product teams, prompt engineers, or subject-matter experts to tune behavior between deploys. Code-defined agents have read-only `id`, `name`, and `model` fields; everything else is editable through Studio.

For production deployment, secure Studio behind authentication. See [Mastra's auth docs](https://mastra.ai/docs/server/auth/overview).

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start Mastra Studio at localhost:4111 |
| `npm run build` | Bundle for production (output → `.mastra/output/`) |
| `npm run start` | Start production server (no Studio) |
| `npm run eval` | Run offline eval gate against all cases in the dataset |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript type check (zero-emit) |
| `npm run score:list` | List registered scorers |

---

## Adding a New Agent

1. Copy `src/mastra/agents/_example.ts` → `src/mastra/agents/my-agent.ts`
2. Rename the agent, update `id`, `instructions`, `model`, tools, and output schema
3. Register it in `src/mastra/index.ts` under `agents:`
4. Add eval cases to a new dataset file in `src/mastra/scorers/datasets/`
5. Use `prompts/build-agent.md` with Claude Code to generate a complete agent from a description

---

## Running Evals

```bash
# Against live Anthropic API
npm run eval

# Against AIMock (deterministic, no API cost)
npx @copilotkit/aimock --config aimock.json &
USE_AIMOCK=true npm run eval

# Custom dataset
node --env-file=.env --import tsx/esm scripts/eval.ts path/to/dataset.json
```

---

## Docker

```bash
# Build
docker build -t my-agent:latest .

# Run
docker compose up -d

# Health check
curl http://localhost:4111/health
```

> **Local Supabase note**: Docker containers can't reach `127.0.0.1` on the host. Set `SUPABASE_DB_URL` to use `host.docker.internal` instead when running via Docker Desktop locally.

---

## Deployment Notes

### Docker image size

The production image is ~676MB. This is larger than typical Node.js Docker images because:

- The base is `node:22-slim` (Debian, glibc) instead of `node:22-alpine` (musl)
- DuckDB ships native binaries that segfault on musl libc, even with `gcompat`
- DuckDB is required by `@mastra/observability` for trace storage

If you need a smaller image, the path is to swap DuckDB for `LibSQLStore` in the observability domain (see `src/mastra/index.ts`). Trade-off: slower trace queries in Mastra Studio, especially under load.

For typical VPS deployments (Hetzner, DigitalOcean, etc.) the 676MB size is not a problem — pulls take seconds and storage is cheap. Only optimize if you're targeting Lambda, Cloud Run cold starts, or memory-constrained environments under 1GB.

## Common Gotchas

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Invalid environment variables` on boot | Missing or malformed `.env` | Check each var listed in the error against `.env.example` |
| `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:54322` | Local Supabase not running | `npx supabase start` |
| Docker container crashes (SIGSEGV) | DuckDB requires glibc, not musl | Use `node:22-slim`, not `node:22-alpine` — see Deployment Notes |
| `ECONNREFUSED` inside Docker | `127.0.0.1` in DB URL | Replace with `host.docker.internal` |
| Agent not listed in Studio | Not registered in `mastra.agents` | Add to `src/mastra/index.ts` |
| Storage init error about missing `id` | `PostgresStore`/`LibSQLStore` requires `id` field | Pass `id: 'mastra-storage'` to the constructor |
| PostHog telemetry noise in restricted networks | Mastra runtime phones home on startup | Set `MASTRA_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` in `.env` |
| DB connection errors at scale | Direct Supabase connection has limited slots | Use the **session pooler** URL from Supabase dashboard (Project Settings → Database → Connection string → Session pooler) |
| Pino transport error in Docker | `pino-pretty` missing from production deps | Ensure it's in `dependencies`, not `devDependencies`, in any packages you add |

---

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for the full list with comments. Minimum required:

- `APP_SECRET` — min 32 chars, generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`
- `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_DB_URL`
- At least one of: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`
