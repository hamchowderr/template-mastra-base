/**
 * # Shared Memory Baseline (working memory enabled)
 *
 * Use this factory instead of `new Memory()` so every agent shares one memory
 * policy:
 *
 *   import { createDefaultMemory } from '../lib/memory';
 *
 *   export const myAgent = new Agent({ ..., memory: createDefaultMemory() });
 *
 * ## What's configured
 *
 *   - Message history     — ON (Mastra default). Recent turns are prepended.
 *   - Working memory      — ON, resource-scoped. A persistent Markdown scratchpad
 *                           the agent updates over time (user profile + session
 *                           state). "resource-scoped" = it persists across ALL of
 *                           a user's threads, not just one conversation.
 *   - Semantic recall     — OFF (intentionally). It adds an embed + vector-query on
 *                           every turn and needs a `vector` store + `embedder` these
 *                           templates don't configure. Enable per-agent only when the
 *                           use case justifies the latency.
 *
 * ## Two things to know when calling agents
 *
 * 1. Storage: this factory passes no `storage`, so Memory inherits the Mastra
 *    instance's PostgresStore (Supabase). Postgres supports the `mastra_resources`
 *    table that resource-scoped working memory requires — no extra setup needed.
 *
 * 2. resourceId is REQUIRED for resource-scoped memory to actually persist per user:
 *
 *      await agent.generate('Hello', {
 *        memory: { thread: 'conversation-123', resource: 'user-alice-456' },
 *      });
 *
 *    Without `resource`, working memory falls back to thread-only behavior.
 *
 * Pass a custom `template` for agents that should track different fields (e.g. a
 * voice agent wants a leaner profile). See https://mastra.ai/docs/memory/working-memory
